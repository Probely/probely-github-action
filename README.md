# Probely Target Scan Action

The Target Scan Action provides an easy and efficient integration of Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) done with [Probely](http://probely.com) into your CI pipelines in GitHub.


## About Probely’s DAST

Probely’s DAST scanner automates and scales web applications and APIs security testing:
Detects over 30,000 potential security vulnerabilities.
Reports the vulnerabilities that matter due to the near-zero number of false positives (0.06% in 2022).
Produces reports of the vulnerabilities found with detailed instructions on how to fix them.

## About the Target Scan Action

The Target Scan Action is the piece that automates Probely’s security testing integrated into your CI pipeline. It is configured in GitHub Actions to execute security tests on every commit to your project’s main branch. This default behavior can, however, be changed and adjusted in GitHub Actions to meet your specific CI needs.
